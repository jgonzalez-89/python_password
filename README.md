## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgonzalez-89/python_password.git
cd python_password
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x generate_password.py
```

(Optional) Move the script to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
sudo mv generate_password.py /usr/local/bin/generate_password
```

Make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

If /usr/local/bin is not in your PATH, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Then, reload the shell configuration file:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # o source ~/.zshrc
```

## Use
To generate a password from the command line, use:

```bash
generate_password -l 16  # To generate a 16-character password
```

Or simply:

```bash
generate_password  # To generate a 32-character password (default)
```

## Tests

To run unit tests, make sure you have pytest installed and run it:

```bash
pytest test_password_generator.py
```
